    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Students will define classes that inherit other classes.\n",
    "2. Students will write code that calls member functions of parent and child class.\n",
    "3. Students will use access control specification to manage which member data and functions from the parent class are accessible to the derived class.\n",
    "4. Students will overload arithmetic, relational, and assignment operators to work with their classes.\n",
    "4. Students will used virtual functions and abstract base classes to implement interfaces in C++.\n",

    "## Quick summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance:** a mechanism for deriving new classes from existing ones. Through inheritance, the child (derived class) receives all members (data and function) of the parent class and can add new member data and functions, or overload parent member functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Code reuse. \n",
    "2. Inheritance = foundation of an important OOP concept, **interfaces** (in C++, interfaces are called abstract base classes). **Polymorphism** is another important OOP concept which is closely linked to the notion of interface."
